Websphere MQ, formerly known as MQ (message queue) series, is an IBM standard for program-to-program messaging across multiple platforms.

The WebSphere MQ monitoring extension can monitor multiple queues managers and their resources, namely queues, topics, channels and listeners The metrics are extracted out using the [PCF command messages](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.adm.doc/q020010_.htm).

The metrics for queue manager, queue, topic, channel and listener can be configured.

The MQ Monitor currently supports IBM Websphere MQ version 7.x, 8.x and 9.x.
